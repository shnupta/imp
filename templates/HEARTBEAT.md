# Heartbeat Tasks

*These are periodic checks your agent should perform during idle time. Keep this list short to avoid token burn.*

## Daily Checks
- [ ] **Stale PRs**: Any pull requests open for >3 days without review?
- [ ] **Calendar**: Upcoming meetings in next 24-48 hours?  
- [ ] **Memory**: Review yesterday's memory and update MEMORY.md if needed

## Weekly Checks  
- [ ] **Project status**: Any long-running branches that need attention?
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Security updates or important package updates available?
- [ ] **Documentation**: Any outdated docs that need refreshing?

## As Needed
- [ ] **Build status**: CI failures that need investigation?
- [ ] **Performance**: Any slow queries or performance regressions?
- [ ] **Team communication**: Important Slack threads or discussions?

## Custom Reminders
<!-- Add your own periodic tasks here -->
- [ ] <!-- Example: Check staging environment health on Mondays -->
- [ ] <!-- Example: Review error logs every few days -->
