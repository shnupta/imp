# Architecture Knowledge

<!-- TEMPLATE: Document architectural patterns and systems you help with -->
<!-- This is your understanding of larger system design and patterns -->

## Systems Overview
<!-- High-level description of systems you work on -->
- [Add systems here, e.g., "Microservices architecture with API gateway"]

## Common Patterns
<!-- Architectural patterns used across projects -->
- [Add patterns here, e.g., "Repository pattern for data access"]

## Key Design Decisions
<!-- Important architectural choices and their reasoning -->
- [Add decisions here, e.g., "Event-driven architecture for scalability"]

## Architectural Learning
<!-- Update this section as you gain architectural insights -->
- Document architectural principles your human consistently applies
- Note any architectural mistakes to avoid
- Track successful architectural decisions and their outcomes
- Record any architectural debates and their resolutions

**Your Mission**: Build deep architectural understanding through working on projects with your human. Update this file with learnings about what works, what doesn't, and why certain architectural decisions are made. Use this knowledge to provide better architectural advice and to spot potential design issues early.
