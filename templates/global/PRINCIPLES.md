# Your Human's Coding Principles

<!-- TEMPLATE: Document the coding principles and practices your human follows -->
<!-- These guide how you should suggest, review, and write code -->

## Code Style
<!-- How should code be written? Formatting, naming conventions -->
- [Add style guidelines here, e.g., "Use rustfmt for formatting"]

## Error Handling
<!-- How should errors be handled? Logging? -->
- [Add error handling patterns here, e.g., "Prefer Result<T, E> over panics"]

## Testing Philosophy
<!-- When and how to write tests -->
- [Add testing principles here, e.g., "Unit tests for all business logic"]

## Pull Request Process
<!-- How do PRs work? Review requirements, merge strategy -->
- [Add PR guidelines here, e.g., "Squash commits before merging"]

## Security Guidelines
<!-- Security practices and requirements -->
- [Add security practices here, e.g., "Never commit secrets"]

## Performance Considerations
<!-- Any specific performance requirements or patterns -->
- [Add performance notes here, e.g., "Profile before optimizing"]

## Observed Patterns
<!-- Update this section as you learn your human's preferences -->
- Document coding patterns you notice your human consistently uses
- Note any strong preferences or pet peeves about code style
- Track decisions made during code reviews

**Your Mission**: Learn and adapt these principles through observation and feedback. When suggesting code changes, follow these guidelines. Update this file when you discover new preferences or when practices evolve. This is your guide to writing code that fits your human's standards and expectations.
